# Marmot Defense

A hardcore tower defense game featuring elemental marmots.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. **Goal:** Survive 20 waves of marmots.
3. **Build Towers:** Click a tower card in the sidebar, then click on the map grid.
4. **Elements Matter:**
   - **Water** > Fire
   - **Fire** > Wind
   - **Wind** > Earth
   - **Earth** > Water
   - **Light** <> **Dark** (Deal 2x damage to each other)
   - **Poison** is effective against biological types (Water, Earth) but weak to elements that disperse it (Fire, Wind).
5. **Upgrading:** Click an existing tower to see stats, upgrade, or sell.
6. **Speed:** Use the "1x Speed" button to toggle 2x speed for fast forwarding.

## Difficulty
This game is designed to be **hard**. You must use the correct elemental counters to survive later waves. Relying on a single tower type will lead to defeat.
